		<p class="style2">Longtime restaurateur remembered</p>
		<p class="style2">by Brian Day</p>
		<p class="style2">Staff Writer</p>
		<p class="style2">A beloved West Covina restaurateur who died in a car 
		crash last week will be buried Wednesday.</p>
		<p class="style3">Born in Mexican, Raudel Guerrero 57, was the owner of 
		the Mariposa Inn restaurant for the past 19 years, said his wife, 
		Julieta Guerrero.</p>
		<p class="style3">&quot;He was very proud that he had come to the United 
		States in search of the American Dream,&quot; she said.</p>
		<p class="style3">Guerrero, who lived in Chino, died after his van 
		crashed into a big rig about 3:40a.m. Thursday on Reservoir Street near 
		Philadelphia Avenue in Pomona said Pomona police Cpl. Bill Knight.</p>
		<p class="style3">&quot;He was a very loving and giving person,&quot; said Julieta 
		Guerrero, adding that her husband was well-known and well-liked in the 
		area.</p>
		<p class="style3">Raudel began working at the Mariposa Inn as a waiter 
		in 1972, family members said.</p>
		<p class="style3">Over the years, he moved up to assistant manager, 
		manager and eventually owner in 1989. Prior to that, he owned a 
		fast-food restaurant in the San Fernando Valley.</p>
		<p class="style3">His wife said the family would never consider closing 
		the restaurant.</p>
		<p class="style3">&quot;He loved it. It was his life,&quot; she said. &quot;He 
		dedicated his life to that restaurant and we want to keep in going&quot;</p>
		<p class="style3">The restaurant will close early Tuesday at 8 p.m. for 
		a Rosary service, Julieta said, and will remain closed all day Wednesday 
		in honor of Raudel.</p>
		<p class="style3">Raudel often spent more time at the restaurant than he 
		did at home, she added.</p>
		<p class="style3">Patrons gathered at the Mariposa Inn Monday said 
		Raudel befriended just about everyone who entered his restaurant.</p>
		<p class="style3">&quot;He&#39;s one of the best business owners in the area,&quot; 
		said Greg Shaw, a patron. &quot;He treated everyone like family. I don&#39;t know 
		what else to say. He&#39;s exceptional.&quot;</p>
		<p class="style3">Shaw added that Raudel was a Dodgers fan, and would 
		often talk baseball with him.</p>
		<p class="style3">&quot;He was always happy,&quot; said another patron, Angel 
		Gonzalez. &quot;This is what kept him happy. Being here.&quot;</p>
		<p class="style3">Dacia Suchite of Pomona said Raudel made her feel like 
		family.</p>
		<p class="style3">His favorite music was Tamborazo and his favorite 
		singer was Antonio Aguilar, who was from Raudel&#39;s hometown of Zacatecas, 
		Mexico.</p>
		<p class="style3">Friends said they plan to have a Tamborazo band play 
		at Raudel&#39;s funeral.</p>
		<p class="style3">&quot;He was a very simple man,&quot; Julieta said. &quot;He never 
		forgot his background.&quot;</p>
		<p class="style3">Gonzalez and Suchite said they will be visiting the 
		restaurant every day for a while to support the family.</p>
		<p class="style3">Several customers said they&#39;ve&nbsp; been frequenting 
		the restaurant for decades because of Raudel&#39;s personality.</p>
		<p class="style3">Julieta described Raudel as an excellent father to 
		their four children and would often volunteer his restaurant to help 
		community organizations.</p>
		<p class="style3">The crash occurred while Raudel was on his way home 
		from work, Julieta said.</p>
		<p class="style3">He had just given a busboy from the restaurant a ride 
		home and was southbound on Reservoir Street when he fell asleep at the 
		wheel, crashing into a big rig, family members and Knight said.</p>
		<p class="style3">Julieta said officials told her Raudel died instantly 
		and without suffering.</p>
		<p class="style3">Rosary is scheduled for today at 7p.m at St. Elizabeth 
		Seton Church in Rowland Heights, 1835 Larkvane Road, Julieta said. A 
		funeral service will be held at the same church Wednesday at 9:30 a.m.</p>
		<p class="style3">Raudel is survived by his wife, four adult children 
		and three grandchildren.</p>
		<p class="style3">&quot;We&#39;re going to miss him,&quot; Angel Gonzalez said, &quot;but 
		he&#39;s in a better place. He needed a rest. He never rested in life. Now 
		he can rest.&quot;</p>
		<p class="style3">&nbsp;</p>
