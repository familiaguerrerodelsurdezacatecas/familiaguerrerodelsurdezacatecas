		<p class="style3">NOTICE OF APPRECIATION</p>
		<p class="style5">Thank you to those who attended last year&#39;s 25<sup>th</sup> 
		Guerrero Family Reunion for the first time. It was a huge success and we 
		also thank those families who have attended the reunion year after year 
		and have been helping with the information for the family tree. Please 
		continue to send any corrections or additions to the family tree to 
		Pancho Guerrero at <a href="mailto:frnqueq@sbcglobal.net">
		frnqueq@sbcglobal.net</a>.</p>
		<p class="style5">Forgive us for not being able to spend more quality 
		time chatting and catching up with all of you this past year. We also 
		were not able to have all of the games and activities for children and 
		adults for lack of more time.</p>
		<p class="style5">We can begin to prepare and plan now for this years&#39; 
		reunion which will be held on Friday and Saturday, July 18 &amp; 19, 2008. 
		How can you help this year? Maybe we will need to begin planning 
		activities on Friday, July 18<sup>th</sup> so that we can have time for 
		all of the games and activities.</p>
		<p class="style5">If you would like to keep in touch and get information 
		about the family history, you may visit the website:
		<a href="http://www.familiaguerrerodelsurdezacatecas.com">
		www.familiaguerrerodelsurdezacatecas.com</a> and send us pictures, 
		especially of those family members who are no longer with us. 
		Furthermore, we are planning to have on the website all family events 
		and activities that you would like to post throughout the year. Such as 
		Bachelor and Bachelorette parties, weddings, anniversaries, baby 
		showers, birth announcements, baptisms, first communions, quinceañeras, 
		birthdays, divorces, and funerals, etc.</p>
		<p class="style5">We also need to continue to support the maintenance of 
		the Guerrero Family website. Get involved by sending us pictures of new 
		and old family members. Let us know if you would or would not like to 
		post photos and names of your family. We look forward to hearing your 
		suggestions or comments</p>
		<p class="style5">&nbsp;</p>
